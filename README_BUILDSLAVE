How to setup a buildslave for PyPy
==================================

First you will need to install the ``buildbot_buildslave`` package.
pip install buildbot_buildslave

The next step is to create a buildslave configuration file. Based on version
0.7.12 of buildbot you need to execute the following command.

buildbot create-slave  BASEDIR MASTERHOST:PORT SLAVENAME PASSWORD

For PyPy the MASTERHOST currently is ``wyvern.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de``. The
value for PORT is ``10407``.
SLAVENAME and PASSWORD can be freely chosen. These values need to be added to
the slaveinfo.py configuration file on the MASTERHOST, ask in the IRC channel
(#pypy on freenode.net) for the settings to be added. BASEDIR is a path to a
local directory that will be created to contain all the files will be used by
the buildslave. 

Finally you will need to update the buildmaster configuration found in
bot2/pypybuildbot/master.py to associate the buildslave with one or more
builders. Builders define what tasks should be executed on the buildslave. 
The changeset of revision 2f982db47d5d is a good place to start
(https://bitbucket.org/pypy/buildbot/changeset/2f982db47d5d). Once the changes
are commited the buildmaster on MASTERHOST needs to be updated and restared to
reflect the changes to the configuration.

To run the buildslave execute 
=============================

First you will need to copy the file Makefile.sample to Makefile and
update it as necessary.

To start the buildslave just run

    make start

and to stop it run

    make stop
