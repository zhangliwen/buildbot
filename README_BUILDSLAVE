How to setup a buildslave for PyPy
==================================

First you will need to install the ``buildbot-slave`` package.
pip install buildbot_buildslave

The next step is to create a buildslave configuration file. Based on version
0.8.7 of buildbot you need to execute the following command.

buildslave create-slave  BASEDIR MASTERHOST:PORT SLAVENAME PASSWORD

For PyPy the MASTERHOST currently is ``buildbot.pypy.org``. The
value for PORT is ``10407``.
SLAVENAME and PASSWORD can be freely chosen. These values need to be added to
the slaveinfo.py configuration file on the MASTERHOST, ask in the IRC channel
(#pypy on freenode.net) for the settings to be added. BASEDIR is a path to a
local directory that will be created to contain all the files will be used by
the buildslave. 

Finally you will need to update the buildmaster configuration found in
bot2/pypybuildbot/master.py to associate the buildslave with one or more
builders. Builders define what tasks should be executed on the buildslave. 
The changeset of revision 2f982db47d5d is a good place to start
(https://bitbucket.org/pypy/buildbot/changeset/2f982db47d5d). Once the changes
are commited the buildmaster on MASTERHOST needs to be updated and restared to
reflect the changes to the configuration.

To run the buildslave execute 
=============================

To start the buildslave just run

    buildslave start BASEDIR

and to stop it run

    buildslave stop BASEDIR
