Everything has been tested with builbot 0.8.8.

How to hack the PyPy buildbot
==============================

If you want to run buildbot locally, you need to:

  1. create a file ``master/slaveinfo.py`` which contains the password for the
     local slave you will run::

         passwords = {"localhost": "an_arbitrary_password" }

  2. ``cd master; make debug``

  3. ``cd slave; make debug``


How to run the PyPy buildbot
============================

If you want to run buildbot in production, you need to make sure that the
function ``pypybuildbot.util.we_are_debugging`` returns ``False`` in your
environment.  At the moment of writing, debugging is enabled everywhere but on
cobra.

You still need to fill ``master/slaveinfo.py`` with the passwords of the
various slaves you want to use.

Then, to start the buildbot master: ``buildbot start <path-to pypy-buildbot/master>``


To restart the buildmaster
===========================

$ cd pypy-buildbot

$ hg pull -u

$ cd master

$ buildbot checkconfig

$ buildbot reconfig

OR

$ buildbot stop

$ buildbot start

To run a buildslave
===================
